# Hammers
Spigot plugin that adds hammers with custom textures and behavior to the game. Utilizes a resourcepack in order to distinguish the hammer from a normal pickaxe.

Credit for the hammer textures goes to [Vanilla Hammers and Excavators](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/vanilla-hammers-and-excavators-for-1-18-1/)
